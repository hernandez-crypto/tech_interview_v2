    Question: Remove Duplicates. Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. How would you solve

     before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only neded to
    be after the elements less than x. The partiton element x can apperar anywhere om the "right partition"; it does

    Question: Intersection. Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect. Return the 
    intersecting node. Note that the intersection is defined based on reference, not just value, That is, if the 
    kth node of the first linked list is the exact same node (by reference) as the jth node of the second linked 
    list then they are intersecting.
